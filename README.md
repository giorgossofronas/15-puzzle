# 15-Puzzle Solver

An A.I. solver made in C simulating the [15-Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game on terminal.<br>
Given an initial 4x4 puzzle, the aim is to reach a specific goal-puzzle in the minimum number of moves.<br>
The A.I. solver achieves that using [IDA* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*) and the sum of [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) and [Linear Conflicts](https://medium.com/swlh/looking-into-k-puzzle-heuristics-6189318eaca2#:~:text=Linear%20Conflicts,reach%20their%20final%20goal%20position.) heuristic.
